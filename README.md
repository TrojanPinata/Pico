# Pico
This project is a precursor to a future project which I aim to use a RP2040 as the microcontroller as the core of a keyboard, very similar to my original keyboard but with PCBA.

The goal of this was to prove the feasability of using PCBA as well as prove my ability to make a functioning RP2040 microcontroller board. The Pi Pico was simply chosen as it was a very accessable option.

If you want to use this project, it should be noted that this is open source, but I would rather you simply use this as a reference. Putting that much confidence in someone elses work is dangerous, and I cannot guarantee spec with the original.
